# AI-Model-Packages-to-Reduce-Insurance-Premium-cost-from-Insured-Persons-Doctors-and-Insurance-Company

## Introduction of Owner

Owner of this GitHub project is Ke Liu, who graduated from NYU's Tandon School of Engineering with the GPA of 3.9, and received the degree of Master of Science in Financial Engineering. Ke Liu

- Accomplished several AI models which are built up to solve financial problems by processing numeric data, text data, image data, time series data etc. The financial problems includes how to price financial derivatives, how to perdict financial index, how to recognize non-numeric data to support financial decisions, and so on. Ke Liu even has an APP-Built-Up experience in UBS, the Union Bank of Switzerland, which utilized NLP methods to tag companies in real time to make reference for investors. All AI projects' details could be found in Ke Liu's LinkedIn profile, https://www.linkedin.com/in/ke-liu-459688218/.

- Researched several national, provincial and industrial projects during her undergraduate school which are focused on investment facilitating, risk management, national development policies as well as regional development system, and published a paper in China. Here's her Google Scholar profile, https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8yJFZ4IAAAAJ. The research experience gave her comprehensive and deep perspective to study and solve problems too.

Now Ke Liu is working for an Insurance Company in New York, and aims to research the reason of increasing insurance premium cost and built AI models package to reduce the insurance premium cost, in order to contribute to the whole USA welfare.

## Background Information

Health insurance expenditure has always been one of the important living expenditure items for American citizens. According to the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), which are the official estimates of total health care spending in the United States, U.S. health care spending grew 4.1 percent in 2022, reaching $4.5 trillion or $13,493 per person. As a share of the nation's Gross Domestic Product, health spending accounted for 17.3 percent.

Among the huge amount of health spending:
- National Health Expenditure(NHE) grew 4.1% to $4.5 trillion in 2022, or $13,493 per person, and accounted for 17.3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
- Medicare spending grew 5.9% to $944.3 billion in 2022, or 21 percent of total NHE.
- Medicaid spending grew 9.6% to $805.7 billion in 2022, or 18 percent of total NHE.
- Private health insurance spending grew 5.9% to $1,289.8 billion in 2022, or 29 percent of total NHE.

Which shown the rapidly growing insurance expenditure. And itâ€™s time to take action to curb the rise in insurance premium costs to improve USA citizen's whole welfare with AI.

## Goals

In this project, Ke Liu has two goals:

- Find the reasons of high insurance expenditure.
- Build AI models to reduce insurance premium cost.
